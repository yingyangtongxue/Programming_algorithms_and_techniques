Contains some simple programs to develop programmer thinking.

## Compiling programs in C through the Linux terminal
For compilation, that is, to create an executable file, just type the following command:
```sh
gcc name_of_file.c -o name_of_executable  
```
To compile files that have the math.h library's pow () function, add -lm to the command line. Example:
```sh
gcc name_of_file.c -o name_of_executable -lm
```
## Running 
Just type:
```sh
./name_of_executable
```
