/*We say that a natural number n with at least two digits is a palindrome if
the 1st digit of n is equal to its last digit,
the 2nd digit of n is equal to the penultimate digit,
and so on.
Examples:
567765 and 32423 are palindromes, while 567675 is not.
Given a natural number n, n â‰¥ 10, check if it is a palindrome.*/
